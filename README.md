# Bug Bounty Programs across the globe

Welcome to my Bug Bounty repository! This project is designed to help new security researchers discover bug bounty programs in various languages such as English, German, French, and more. By expanding your search beyond English, you can uncover private or lesser-known bug bounty programs in other languages, giving you an edge in finding vulnerabilities with less competition.

## üìå Why Explore Bug Bounty Programs in Different Languages?

Most bug bounty programs are often searched for in English, leading to high competition among researchers. However, many companies and platforms around the world offer bug bounty programs in their native languages, which may have fewer researchers participating. By exploring these programs, you can:

- **Find Less-Explored Programs**: Access bug bounty programs with fewer participants, increasing your chances of finding vulnerabilities.
- **Expand Your Reach**: Gain experience working with companies and platforms that cater to non-English speaking regions.
- **Enhance Your Skills**: Learn to navigate and understand security in different linguistic and cultural contexts, making you a more versatile researcher.

## üôÉ How do I Explore the site if its in a foreign language?

I highly recommend that you use Chrome for your web bug bounty hunting :) It offers a built in translation option that can make it very simple to translate the page to a language that you can understand.
